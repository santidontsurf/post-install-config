<h2>Installation Steps</h2>

<p>
</p>
<p>
Using Microsoft Azure portal(portal.azure.com) we will create a virtual machine (VM) to use as a testing ground for this project and protect our physical device from anything that might malfunction along the way. VM's also allow us to use an operating system different from the one our device uses, in this case we will be using a Windows 11 Pro VM on a Macbook laptop.

 *(If you are working on a Windows laptop already you can skip the first three steps and starts at step four (IIS))*
</p>
<p>
In Azure, create a resource group and title it "osTicketrg" then a virtual network under that same resource group titled "osticketrg-vnet". Afterwards create a VM with 2 vcpus, 8 GiB Memory and put it under the same resource group.
